## Environment Variables Changes

### ‚ùå OLD (Service Account - Remove These):
```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=pavan-631@swarna-wedding.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

### ‚úÖ NEW (OAuth 2.0 - Add These):
```env
# OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-your-client-secret

# NextAuth configuration
AUTH_SECRET=generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Keep this (unchanged)
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=10owBvniraOqfEnnDm_HgIBHsm71h3RnL
```

## How It Works Now

### User Flow

#### Before (Service Account):
1. User opens app ‚Üí Upload page immediately
2. Select files ‚Üí Upload
3. ‚ùå ERROR: "Service Accounts do not have storage quota"

#### After (OAuth 2.0):
1. User opens app ‚Üí "Sign in with Google" button
2. User clicks sign in ‚Üí Redirected to Google
3. User logs in and grants permissions
4. Redirected back to app ‚Üí Upload form appears
5. Select files ‚Üí Upload ‚úÖ
6. Files uploaded to user's own Drive
7. Files appear in your specified folder (because of folder ID)
8. No storage quota errors! ‚úÖ

### Technical Flow

1. **Authentication:**
   - User signs in with Google OAuth
   - NextAuth exchanges authorization code for access token
   - Access token stored in JWT session cookie

2. **Upload:**
   - User submits files
   - API route checks session for access token
   - If not authenticated ‚Üí 401 error
   - If authenticated ‚Üí Pass token to Drive API
   - Drive API uploads files as the user (using their quota)
   - Files created in specified folder

3. **View Gallery:**
   - API route checks session
   - If authenticated ‚Üí Fetch files from Drive using user's token
   - Display in gallery

## Security & Privacy Improvements

### ‚úÖ Minimal Scope
- Only uses `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`
- This gives access ONLY to files created by the app
- NOT full Drive access
- Complies with Google's 2025 User Data Policy

### ‚úÖ User Control
- Users can revoke access anytime from Google account settings
- Transparent permission request
- Users know exactly what they're authorizing

### ‚úÖ No Exposed Secrets
- No service account private key in code or repo
- Client secret only in secure environment variables
- More secure than service account key file

### ‚úÖ File Ownership
- Files owned by the user who uploaded them
- Uses their Drive quota, not yours
- Better for compliance and data ownership

## What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Create OAuth Credentials (Required)

Follow [OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md](OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md) Step 1:
- Go to Google Cloud Console
- Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- Configure consent screen
- Get Client ID and Client Secret

### 2. Update Environment Variables (Required)

Create/update `.env.local`:
```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-secret
AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=10owBvniraOqfEnnDm_HgIBHsm71h3RnL
```

### 3. Configure Folder Permissions (Required)

Make your Drive folder accessible:
1. Open Google Drive
2. Find folder `10owBvniraOqfEnnDm_HgIBHsm71h3RnL`
3. Right-click ‚Üí Share
4. Change to "Anyone with the link" ‚Üí "Editor"
5. Save

### 4. Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000:
- Sign in with Google
- Grant permissions
- Upload a test image
- Check Drive folder
- View gallery

### 5. Deploy to Production

Follow [OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md](OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md) Step 5:
- Add production redirect URI to OAuth config
- Set environment variables in Vercel
- Deploy
- Test on production URL

---

## Breaking Changes

### User Experience
- **NEW:** Users must sign in before uploading
- **NEW:** One extra step (Google OAuth flow)
- **BENEFIT:** More transparent, secure, and reliable

### Developer Setup
- **REMOVED:** Service account JSON file no longer needed
- **NEW:** OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
- **NEW:** Additional environment variables required

### Code Changes
- All Google Drive functions now require `accessToken` parameter
- All pages using Drive features must check authentication
- Client components wrapped with `SessionProvider`

## Migration Checklist

Use this to track your progress:

- [ ] Read [OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md](OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Configure OAuth consent screen
- [ ] Get Client ID and Client Secret
- [ ] Generate AUTH_SECRET (`openssl rand -base64 32`)
- [ ] Update `.env.local` with new variables
- [ ] Remove old service account variables
- [ ] Make Drive folder accessible (Anyone with link - Editor)
- [ ] Test locally:
  - [ ] Sign in works
  - [ ] Upload works
  - [ ] Files appear in Drive
  - [ ] Gallery works
  - [ ] Video upload works
- [ ] Add production redirect URI to OAuth config
- [ ] Set environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Test on production URL
- [ ] Generate QR code
- [ ] Test QR code on phone

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you need to rollback to service account (not recommended):

```bash
git revert HEAD
npm install
```

Then restore old `.env.local` with service account variables.

**NOTE:** This will bring back the storage quota error. It's better to fix OAuth setup than rollback.

## Benefits Summary

### Why This Change Was Necessary

| Issue | Service Account | OAuth 2.0 |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Storage Quota** | ‚ùå No quota, uploads fail | ‚úÖ Uses user's quota |
| **File Ownership** | ‚ùå Service account owns (impossible) | ‚úÖ User owns files |
| **Security** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Private key in repo | ‚úÖ No keys, tokens only |
| **Compliance** | ‚ùå Against Google 2025 policy | ‚úÖ Compliant |
| **User Control** | ‚ùå No visibility | ‚úÖ User grants permission |
| **Setup Complexity** | üü° Moderate | üü° Moderate |
| **User Experience** | ‚úÖ No sign-in needed | üü° Must sign in |

**Overall:** OAuth 2.0 is the correct solution for your use case.

## Next Wedding Feature Ideas (Future)

Now that authentication is working, you could add:
- User profiles (show who uploaded each photo)
- Comments on photos
- Likes/reactions
- Photo albums/categories
- Download all photos button
- Slideshow mode
- Guest book / messages

These are optional - your app is fully functional now! üéâ
