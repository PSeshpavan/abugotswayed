## üöÄ How It Works

### Upload Flow:
```
1. User selects files (photos + videos)
2. Client validates:
   - Video format (MP4 only)
   - Video size (max 100MB)
3. Shows preview (video icon for videos)
4. Uploads to server
5. Server processes:
   - Photos: Compress + optimize
   - Videos: Direct upload (fast!)
6. Saves to Google Drive
7. Sets public permissions
8. Returns success message
```

### Gallery Flow:
```
1. Fetch media from Google Drive
   - Query: images OR videos
   - Order: Latest first
   - Limit: 15 at a time
2. Render thumbnails
   - Google Drive auto-generates thumbnails
   - Add play icon for videos
3. User clicks video
   - Open modal
   - Load video from Drive
   - Start playback
4. Real-time updates
   - Poll every 10 seconds
   - Show new photos + videos
```
