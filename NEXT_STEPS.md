## üéØ What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Restart the Development Server (IMPORTANT!)

The code has been updated with the Google Drive fix. You need to restart:

```bash
# If dev server is running, stop it (Ctrl+C)

# Start it again
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Upload (This Should Work Now!)

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Upload a test image
3. Check if it appears in your Google Drive folder
4. Check if it appears in the gallery

**If it works:** Congratulations! Move to Step 3.

**If it still fails:**
- Double-check the service account has "Editor" permission on the folder
- Verify your `.env.local` has the correct credentials
- Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions

### Step 3: Complete Testing

Follow the comprehensive testing guide:

```bash
# Open the testing guide
cat TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

Or just open [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md) in your code editor.

Test these critical features:
- [ ] Image upload works
- [ ] Video upload works
- [ ] Gallery displays media correctly
- [ ] Infinite scroll works
- [ ] Real-time updates work
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Video playback in modal

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

Once local testing passes:

1. Follow [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy
4. Test on production URL

### Step 5: Generate QR Code

After deployment:

```bash
npm run generate-qr https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
```

This creates `wedding-qr-code.png` - print this for your wedding!

### Step 6: Final Pre-Wedding Test

1 day before the wedding:
- Test the QR code by scanning with your phone
- Upload from your phone
- Verify everything works on mobile
- Print multiple copies of the QR code (8x10 inches recommended)
