## Next Steps (Do This Now!)

### 1. Set Up Google Drive API (30 minutes)

Open [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) and follow ALL steps carefully to:

1. Create Google Cloud project
2. Enable Google Drive API
3. Create service account
4. Download credentials JSON
5. Create/use Google Drive folder for photos
6. Share folder with service account
7. Configure `.env.local`

**This is the MOST IMPORTANT step. Don't skip any part!**

### 2. Test Locally (5 minutes)

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd c:\Users\Dark\Documents\Swarna-wedding

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Test these things:**
- [ ] Upload page loads
- [ ] Can select images
- [ ] Images upload successfully
- [ ] Check Google Drive folder - images should appear there
- [ ] Visit [http://localhost:3000/gallery](http://localhost:3000/gallery)
- [ ] Gallery shows uploaded images
- [ ] Upload more images and wait 10 seconds - they should auto-appear

### 3. Deploy to Vercel (15 minutes)

#### First Time Git Setup

```bash
# Initialize git (if not done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Wedding photo app"
```

#### Push to GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Copy the repository URL
3. Run:

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Deploy on Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select your repository
5. **IMPORTANT**: Add Environment Variables:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL` (from your JSON credentials)
   - `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` (from your JSON credentials - keep the quotes!)
   - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` (your Drive folder ID)
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
8. **Copy your Vercel URL** (e.g., `https://swarna-wedding.vercel.app`)

### 4. Generate QR Code (2 minutes)

```bash
# Replace with YOUR actual Vercel URL
npm run generate-qr https://YOUR-APP-NAME.vercel.app
```

This creates `public/qr-code.png`

**Print this QR code!** You can also view it at: `https://YOUR-APP-NAME.vercel.app/qr`

### 5. Test Production (5 minutes)

Visit your Vercel URL and test:
- [ ] Upload works
- [ ] Images appear in Google Drive
- [ ] Gallery loads images
- [ ] Test on mobile phone
- [ ] Scan QR code with phone
- [ ] Try uploading from phone

## Troubleshooting

### "Upload failed"
→ Check `.env.local` has correct credentials
→ Verify service account has access to Drive folder
→ Check Vercel environment variables match exactly

### "Images not showing in gallery"
→ Check images are in Drive folder
→ Verify folder ID is correct
→ Check browser console for errors (F12)

### "QR code not found"
→ Run `npm run generate-qr YOUR_URL` first
→ Check `public/qr-code.png` exists

## Wedding Day Tips

1. **Test QR codes the day before** - print and scan them
2. **Place QR codes everywhere**:
   - Guest tables
   - Photo booth
   - Entrance/welcome table
   - Near the dance floor
3. **Brief 1-2 people** to help guests who need assistance
4. **Monitor uploads** during the event (optional)
5. **Keep WiFi info handy** in case guests ask

- **Upload Page**: `https://YOUR-APP.vercel.app/`
- **Gallery**: `https://YOUR-APP.vercel.app/gallery`
- **QR Code**: `https://YOUR-APP.vercel.app/qr`
