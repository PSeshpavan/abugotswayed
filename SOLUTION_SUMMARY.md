## ‚ö†Ô∏è Google Drive Issue Fixed!

### The Problem:
You were getting this error:
```
Error: Service Accounts do not have storage quota
```

### The Root Cause:
**Google service accounts don't have their own storage.** They need to upload to a folder that's owned by a regular Google account (YOUR account) and shared with the service account. Additionally, when using free Gmail accounts with shared folders, the Google Drive API requires the `supportsAllDrives` parameter.

### The Solution (2 Parts):

#### Part 1: Share the folder with your service account

1. **Open [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)**

2. **Find your wedding photos folder**

3. **Right-click the folder ‚Üí Click "Share"**

4. **Add the service account email:**
   - Look in your `.env.local` file for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - Or open your credentials JSON file and find `client_email`
   - Example: `pavan-631@swarna-wedding.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

5. **Paste this email in the "Add people and groups" field**

6. **IMPORTANT: Change permission to "Editor"** (not Viewer!)

7. **Uncheck "Notify people"** (it's not a real person)

8. **Click "Share"**

9. **Verify:**
   - The service account email should now appear under "People with access"
   - It should show "Editor" permission

#### Part 2: Enable shared drive support (ALREADY DONE)

I've updated the code to include `supportsAllDrives: true` in all Google Drive API calls. This tells the API to work with shared folders properly, which is required for free Gmail accounts.

Changes made in [lib/google-drive.ts](lib/google-drive.ts):
- Added `supportsAllDrives: true` to all `drive.files.create()` calls
- Added `supportsAllDrives: true` to all `drive.permissions.create()` calls
- Added `supportsAllDrives: true` and `includeItemsFromAllDrives: true` to `drive.files.list()` calls

### What Happens After Fixing:
- Images and videos will be uploaded to YOUR Google Drive (using YOUR storage quota)
- The service account has permission to write to your folder
- Your wedding guests can upload photos and videos successfully!
- Media will appear in the gallery in real-time
